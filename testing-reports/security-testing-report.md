## Vulnerability Assessment

### 1. Dependency Security Audit

#### 1.1 NPM Audit Results
**Status**: ⚠️ **2 Moderate Vulnerabilities (Development Only)**

```
esbuild <=0.24.2 - Moderate Severity
- Issue: Development server request vulnerability
- Impact: Development environment only
- Production Risk: NONE (not used in production builds)
- Recommendation: Monitor for updates, not critical for production

vite 0.11.0 - 6.1.6 - Moderate Severity  
- Issue: Depends on vulnerable esbuild version
- Impact: Development environment only
- Production Risk: NONE (build tool only)
- Recommendation: Update when stable version available
```

**Assessment**: These vulnerabilities affect only the development server and build tools. Production builds are not affected as esbuild is not included in the final bundle.

#### 1.2 Production Dependencies Analysis
**Status**: ✅ **SECURE**

All production dependencies have been analyzed:
- React 18.3.1: Latest stable, no known vulnerabilities
- React Router DOM 6.26.2: Latest stable, secure
- Lucide React 0.462.0: Icon library, no security concerns
- TanStack Query 5.56.2: Latest stable, secure
- All other dependencies: Current and secure

### 2. Client-Side Security Testing

#### 2.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
**Status**: ✅ **SECURE**

**Tests Performed**:
- Input sanitization in contact forms: N/A (no forms present)
- Dynamic content rendering: All content is static or properly escaped
- External link handling: Proper `rel="noopener noreferrer"` implemented
- User-generated content: None present

**Findings**: No XSS vulnerabilities detected. React's built-in XSS protection is properly utilized.

#### 2.2 Content Security Policy (CSP)
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Current State**: No CSP headers implemented (standard for static sites)
**Recommendation**: Implement CSP headers at server/CDN level during deployment
**Suggested CSP**:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; 
  img-src 'self' data: https:; 
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
  script-src 'self'; 
  connect-src 'self' https://wa.me;
```

#### 2.3 External Resource Security
**Status**: ✅ **SECURE**

**External Links Audit**:
- WhatsApp: `https://wa.me/4917623152477` - Secure, proper implementation
- Email: `mailto:info@suzreinigung.de` - Secure, no vulnerabilities
- Phone: `tel:+4917623152477` - Secure, proper format
