## Error Log & Lessons Learned

### 2025-06-27 - CSS Import Order Issue
**Problem**: Build failed due to @import statement appearing after @tailwind directives in index.css
**Root Cause**: CSS @import rules must appear before all other CSS rules except @charset
**Solution**: Moved @import url() statement to the top of index.css file before @tailwind directives
**Prevention**: Always place @import statements at the beginning of CSS files
**Time Impact**: 5 minutes

### 2025-06-27 - PowerShell Command Syntax
**Problem**: PowerShell doesn't recognize && operator for chaining commands
