## üöÄ Next Steps Required

### 1. EmailJS Account Setup (Required)

Follow the detailed guide in `EMAILJS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`:

1. Create free EmailJS account at [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Configure email service with your SMTP settings:
   - Server: mail.privateemail.com
   - Email: info@suzreinigung.de
   - Password: @@ali@@321@@
3. Create two email templates (templates provided in guide)
4. Get your Service ID, Template IDs, and Public Key

### 2. Environment Configuration

Update `.env` file with your actual EmailJS credentials:

```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_actual_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID_QUOTE=your_quote_template_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID_BOOKING=your_booking_template_id
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_public_key
```

### 3. Testing

1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Test both forms:
   - Quote request form (on service pages)
   - Booking calendar (advanced booking)
3. Check your email (info@suzreinigung.de) for test messages
4. Verify fallback mailto links work if EmailJS is disabled

### 4. Production Deployment

Add the same environment variables to your Vercel project:
- Go to Vercel project settings
- Add environment variables with same names and values
- Redeploy your site
